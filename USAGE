Description:

    The app_config generator creates an application.yml file in which you can
    store some essential settings for your rails application. The code it
    generates was inspired by Topfunky's Rails Code Review PDF, available
    here: http://peepcode.com/products/draft-rails-code-review-pdf

Example:
    
    ./script/generate app_config

    This will create two files:

    config/application.yml
    config/initializers/application_config.rb
